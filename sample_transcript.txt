I discovered this productivity method completely by accident. I was struggling with procrastination and getting overwhelmed by my to-do list. Then I tried this technique where you write down only 3 things you want to accomplish each day, but here's the twist - you have to complete them in order and you can't move to the next one until the first is done. It sounds simple but it changed everything. I went from being constantly stressed to actually finishing important projects. Most people make their lists too long and then feel defeated. But when you focus on just 3 things, your brain doesn't get overwhelmed. I've been using this for 6 months now and my productivity has doubled. The key is being really specific about what counts as 'done' for each task.
