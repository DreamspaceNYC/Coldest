# ðŸ“‹ DATABUTTON SUBMISSION CHECKLIST

## WHAT TO UPLOAD TO DATABUTTON:

### 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION (COPY-PASTE THIS):
```
I want to build a TikTok Hook Generator web app that helps content creators generate viral hook lines using AI.

CORE FEATURES:
- Beautiful React frontend with purple/pink gradient design
- FastAPI backend with OpenRouter AI integration  
- Two input methods: Topic-based and Transcript-based generation
- Generate 3-10 viral TikTok hooks per request
- Progressive Web App (PWA) that works like native iPhone app
- Offline functionality with template fallback
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Mobile-first responsive design

USER FLOW:
1. User enters a topic (like "fitness tips") or pastes transcript
2. Selects number of hooks to generate (3, 5, 7, or 10)
3. Clicks "Generate Viral Hooks" button
4. AI generates scroll-stopping hooks under 15 words each
5. Results display as numbered list with copy buttons
6. Can install as PWA on iPhone for native app experience

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI + OpenRouter API
- AI Model: openrouter/auto (automatically selects best)
- PWA: Service worker + manifest for offline capability
- Mobile: iPhone optimized, add-to-homescreen ready

The app should feel professional and be something content creators would pay for. Focus on beautiful UI, fast performance, and reliable AI hook generation.
```
